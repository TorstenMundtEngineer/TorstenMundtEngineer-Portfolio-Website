## Overview

This website introduces me as a **final-year Engineering (Honours) student at Monash University**, showcases my projects, and provides ways to get in touch. It highlights my passion for integrating mechanical, electrical, and software engineering to create real-world solutions.

Graduating in June 2026, I aim to secure my first full-time engineering role. Beyond engineering, I enjoy travelling, attending AFL games, mentoring in STEM, learning languages, and playing jazz saxophone.
